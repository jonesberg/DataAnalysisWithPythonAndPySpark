# Data Analysis with Python and PySpark

This is the companion repository for the _Data Analysis with Python and PySpark_
book (Manning, estimated publishing date: 2022.) It contains the source
code and data download scripts, when pertinent.

## Get the data

The complete data set for the book hovers at around ~1GB. Because of this, [I
moved the data sources to another repository](
https://github.com/jonesberg/DataAnalysisWithPythonAndPySpark-Data) to
avoid cloning a gigantic repository just to get the code. The book assumes the data is under
`./data`.

## Mistakes or omissions

If you encounter mistakes in the book manuscript (including the printed source
code), please use the Manning platform to provide feedback.
